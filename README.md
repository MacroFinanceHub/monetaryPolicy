We can plot the following:
* **Autocorrelation function** (confirm with Prof. Hawkins what this is?) and/or
* **Impulse response function** of the variables
	* Output gap
	* Inflation
	* Interest rate
	* Output

* In the Excel file in the /OUTPUT folder, we get the impulse response for the variables:
	* Output gap
	* Inflation
	* Interest rate
	* Output

For $$n$$ periods, default is 20.
These are plotted for each and every model that we have selected.

* We can also choose to *show* the **Unconditional variances** for these 4 variables for each and every model that we choose.
